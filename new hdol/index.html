            <h2>Roadmap</h2>
            <p>Here’s our detailed roadmap that outlines our planned steps for building HODL HOG and achieving our vision. We are committed to delivering each phase with passion and consistency.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Phase 1 - Launch and Community Building</h3>
                    <p>Launch the HOG token, build community on X (formerly Twitter), Telegram, and Discord. Focus on increasing visibility and engaging with early adopters. First listing on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like SushiSwap and QuickSwap.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Phase 2 - Staking and Rewards</h3>
                    <p>Implement staking mechanisms for HOG holders to earn rewards. Launch initial marketing push to grow the community. Establish partnerships with influencers and meme crypto communities.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Phase 3 - HOG-verse Development</h3>
                    <p>Launch the **HOG-verse**, an interactive ecosystem for HOG holders, with unique features like NFTs, in-game rewards, and community engagement activities. Introduce DAO governance for decentralized decision-making.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Phase 4 - Expansion & Cross-Chain Partnerships</h3>
                    <p>Expand to other blockchain networks (e.g., Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum). Partner with other meme coins and major crypto projects for ecosystem growth. Host community events and burn events to keep supply low and demand high.</p>
                </li>
